Psilib V1.0

build 1: The first published release of psilib.

Previous versions called SetupDist SetupDistErr and had an additional
function SetupDist that setups a 2D pdf, excluding estimation of p_err.
Since that can be achieved by the user by setting n_p_err to 1, this
option has been removed. Programs written for the earlier version need
to change their calls to SetupDist to include additional parameters for
p_err and the psf. Calls to SetupDistErr should just be renamed to 
SetupDist.
